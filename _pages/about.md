### Motivation
I want to develop **data-driven solutions to materials problems** for a living. I thrive in **collaborative**, inquisitive environments. I value both intra-team and outward-facing **communication** very highly. 

### Background
- B.S. in Physics, Mathematics @ *University of Puget Sound*
- Summer REU in perovskite synthesis @ *University of Minnesota*
- Summer REU in molecular dynamics @ *Boise State University*

### Current Work
- NSF Graduate Research Fellow @ *Northwestern University* ([MTD Group](https://mtd.mccormick.northwestern.edu/))
    - Discovering and tuning ferroelectric materials
    - Developing design rules for metal-insulator transition materials
    - PhD anticipated Spring 2024

    
- Computational materials intern @ *Sandia National Laboratories*
    - Building neural network surrogate models for atomistic simulation

<!-- ### Future Work
- Open to: Research and analytics positions in materials science, data science, and everything in between
- Dream job: Building autonomous materials discovery workflows -->


<!-- - **Current work**: I leverage materials informatics and first-principles methods to study the structure-property relationships in inorganic materials. -->
<!-- - Broad competency across Bayesian and frequentist machine learning methods and first-principles calculation, in both high-throughput and high-fidelity settings  -->
<!-- For my thesis work, I leverage materials informatics and first-principles methods to study the structure-property relationships in inorganic materials. My current foci are , active learning in neural network surrogate models for atomistic simulation, and elucidating the interplay between electronic, magnetic, and lattice-dynamical forces that drive metal-insulator transitions. -->
