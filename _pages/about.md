- NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the [Materials Theory and Design Group](https://mtd.mccormick.northwestern.edu/) (Rondinelli) at Northwestern University (PhD anticipated Spring 2024)
    - Ferroelectric materials discovery
    - Developing design rules for metal-insulator transition materials
- Part-time computational materials intern at Sandia National Laboratories
    - Active learning in neural network surrogate models for atomistic simulation
- Dream job: Building autonomous materials discovery workflows

I am exploring research and analytics positions in materials science, data science, and everything in between.

<!-- - **Current work**: I leverage materials informatics and first-principles methods to study the structure-property relationships in inorganic materials. -->
<!-- - Broad competency across Bayesian and frequentist machine learning methods and first-principles calculation, in both high-throughput and high-fidelity settings  -->
<!-- For my thesis work, I leverage materials informatics and first-principles methods to study the structure-property relationships in inorganic materials. My current foci are , active learning in neural network surrogate models for atomistic simulation, and elucidating the interplay between electronic, magnetic, and lattice-dynamical forces that drive metal-insulator transitions. -->
